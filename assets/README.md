# Day-Scheduler


## Description


This website can be used to schedule your workday between the hours between 9am-5pm.

- I was motivated to make this because I needed to have a calendar that only displayed my workday and also told me what time block i'm currently working in upon checking it.
- This can be used to help you focus on whatever you scheduled for a specific time block.
- From making this I learned that jQuery is very outdated and that most all of it is now in vanilla JavaScript including dates and times. I also learned a hand full of functions like bubble, date.gethours, and split. 


## Installation

Just follow this link to use the day scheduler

## Usage

Follow the link above and check the current time near the top. If the current time is within the hours available on the day scheduler then that time block will appear red. Everything in the past that is within the hours available will appear grey and everything in the future that is within the hours available will appear in green. Upon start up it will look like this image below
