# Day-Scheduler


## Description


This website can be used to schedule your workday between the hours between 9am-5pm.

- I was motivated to make this because I needed to have a calendar that only displayed my workday and also told me what time block i'm currently working in upon checking it.
- This can be used to help you focus on whatever you scheduled for a specific time block.
- From making this I learned that jQuery is very outdated and that most all of it is now in vanilla JavaScript including dates and times. I also learned a hand full of functions like bubble, date.gethours, and split. 


## Installation

Just follow this link to use the day scheduler


## Usage

Follow the link above and check the current time near the top. If the current time is within the hours available on the day scheduler then that time block will appear red. Everything in the past that is within the hours available will appear grey and everything in the future that is within the hours available will appear in green. Upon start up it will look like this image below

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
